      Identity and Web Design done collaboratively with
      <a href="http://twitter.com/mraquelsantos" target="_blank">Marta Dos Santos</a>.
      Stylize/d is a fashion blog eager to show the final fashion editorials and
      the process in making them. The identity had to radically stay from
      mainstream fashion blogs with pink or yellow tones and cursive typefaces. The
      logo was designed to stand out with it's geometric, clean, and monochrome
      approach.

      The logotype was designed in a variation of outline and fill, both intended to
      be used on top of an image or as a masking shape. The typefaces chosen were
      <a href="http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface2" target="blank">Neturaface 2
      Display</a> and <a href="http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1703"

      This forward connects the word stylize to the word stylized as a parallel to the
      approach of documenting the process of fashion rather than just its outcome.
      This was established with the briefing and we decided to use the curious
      forward slash as an element of the brand, the symbol. This symbol was also
      designed to combined with photography and resulted in suitable avatar for
      social networks.
