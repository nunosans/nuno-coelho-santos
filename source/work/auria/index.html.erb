      eco-friendly swimwear brand led by designers

      to bring thicker lines and better readability.

      This project had a small budget and a goal of showcasing the
      photography at its best. The website aims to draw in the user with a
      simple grid and interesting use of layout, letting the content breathe
      and seduce the user. The navigation is aimed to be as simple as possible,
      the user should not have to struggle with understanding the navigation of
      finding information. Everything is given as a first impression.

      to resize and save all the artwork into 12 different sizes for web to fit
      the 6 column grid in standard and high-resolution screens. The typeface is
