      This iPhone application is a client for the Mac application
      <a href="http://v1.kickoffapp.com/" target="_blank">Kickoff</a>. Kickoff
      is a project manager tool with shared notes, chat, tasks and files. Keepon
      seeks to make all information available on-the-go. We wanted to
      keep the transition between the desktop and the mobile app simple and
      intuitive, sharing a similar structure and hierarchy but using the native
      components and established navigation systems.

      and fewer bugs. The next version of the app, 1.2, will include a
      completely bespoke <acronym title="User Interface">UI</acronym>.
