      This iPhone application is a client for the Mac application
      <a href="http://v1.kickoffapp.com/" target="_blank">Kickoff</a>. Kickoff
      is a project manager tool with shared notes, chat, tasks and files. Keepon
      seeks to make all information available on-the-go. We wanted to
      keep the transition between the desktop and the mobile app simple and
      intuitive, sharing a similar structure and hierarchy but using the native
      components and established navigation systems.

      The current version, 1.1, has improved usability on the original version
      and fewer bugs. The next version of the app, 1.2, will include a
      completely bespoke <acronym title="User Interface">UI</acronym>.
